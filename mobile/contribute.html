                <h1>Contribution Information</h1>
            </center>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are looking for contributions of any kind - 
            not just monetary. Below is a list of all the ways you personally 
            can contribute to make Image Sourcerer better. Before that, though, 
            it's important to address where your monetary contributions will 
            go. Our first priority is buying a server and a domain. Once we 
            do that, many other features will be unlocked for everyone, such 
            as firefox support, automatic submission forms and much faster 
            download times for Pixiv and some of reddit, plus much more. After 
            that, the proceeds will go to speeding up the development of the 
            extension. If you would like to specify where you want your 
            contribution to go, reach out to us and we will accomodate you!
            <b>All recurring donators will be notified when the first goal 
            has been reached in case they would like to stop donating.</b>

            </center>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That's right, you can buy Image Sourcerer merch! Or, 
            at least, you will be able to in the very near future. By doing this, 
            you contribute a small portion of what you pay to us, and you get other 
            people to learn about us as well!<br>

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is by far the best way to contribute to 
            the growth of Image Sourcerer! The more people that use it, the 
            more excited we are to work on it for everyone! We really 
            appreciate you telling your friends about Image Sourcerer if 
            you enjoy it. We may be able to secure fundraising once the 
            <a href="https://github.com/JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer" target="_blank">GitHub 
            repository</a> reaches 100 stars, so please star it if you have 
            an account as well!

            </center>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Outside of telling other people about Image 
            Sourcerer, donating is the best thing you can do. We will 
            happily accept anything you're willing to give to reach our 
            goals. That said, the website we accept donations through 
            only allows you to donate on a regular basis - this can be 
            avoided by cancelling your donations after the first one. 
            If we can get just 10 people donating $3 per week, we will 
            be able to afford the domain and server in under two months!<br>
