                <h1>What Is Image Sourcerer?</h1>
            </center>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Image Sourcerer is a browser extension that 
            enables users to locally save images while keeping track of 
            the artist. It has two main and separate functionalities.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;First, it allows you to control where you 
            save images much more efficiently. When downloading a lot of 
            images, it can take a lot of time to navigate through all the 
            folders and save the image manually. By using a text-only 
            interface to choose the locations and names of the images, you 
            can save a lot of time. It does take some getting used to in 
            order to reach that level of efficiency, but it makes downloading 
            images a lot easier once you are!<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The second functionallity is keeping track 
            of the source of the image. It can be impossible to remember the 
            artist of every image you like, much less the link to the original 
            post! It's important to give credit to the artist when sharing their 
            images, so Image Sourcerer embeds the relevant data into the image 
            itself. At any time in the future, you can decode that information 
            to see the artist, link to the post, etc. That data stays intact 
            when you send the image most of the time as well (read the <b>
            Transferring Images</b> section in the help page for more details).

            </center>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Image Sourcerer will be a rolling release - there 
            will never be a final version. The dev team will constantly be 
            working on adding new site supports or features. That said, there are 
            a few major points apart from site support that will be delivered in 
            the future, although some depend on funding:
            <ul>
                <li>Firefox/non-chrome support (depends on funding)</li>
                <li>Automatic source detection for corrupted images</li>
                <li>Metadata embedding (safer, more reliable)</li>
                <li>Other language support</li>
                <li>And many more!</li>
            </ul>
