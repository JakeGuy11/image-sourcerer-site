        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Image Sourcerer is currently not on the chrome store. 
        We have plans to put it up as soon as we have a working version with no 
        known bugs. Until then, read the next part to download it manually.

        </center>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you don't want to install Image Sourcerer through 
        the chrome store, you can download and install it manually. Directly 
        below is a link to download the latest full version, and the next section 
        contains instructions on how to install it.<br>
        <center><a href="releases/image-sourcerer-latest.zip">Click here to download the latest version</a></center>

            <h1 style="margin-top:50px;">Installation Instructions</h1>
        </center>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;These instructions assume you've already downloaded 
            the version you want to install. The beta versions and working 
            versions are linked below. Follow these instructions regardless 
            of which version you're installing:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Extract the zip into a safe place. </b>A good place is somewhere like your Documents folder.</li>
                <li><b>Navigate to [browser]://extensions. </b>This will take you to the extension page. <code>[browser]</code> should be replaced with the name of your browser, ex. <code>chrome://extensions</code>, <code>brave://extensions</code>, etc.</li>
                <li><b>Toggle Developer Mode to on. </b>There will be a switch in one of the corners labeled "developer mode". Toggling it on will allow you to load extensions from a folder.</li>
                <li><b>Click "Load unpacked" and navigate to the folder where you extracted Image Sourcerer. </b>Select it.</li>
                <li><b>Start using Image Sourcerer! </b> The installation is complete! If you overwrite the local files with a newer version, you will need to hit the reload button on the Image Sourcerer panel in the extension page in order for the changes to take effect.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1 style="margin-top:50px;">Beta Version</h1>
        </center>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is not reccomended that you use beta versions 
        unless advised otherwise by a dev. They are often unstable, contain 
        bugs and have partially-finished features. If you would still like to 
        download a beta version, they can all be found <a href="https://github.com/JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer/releases">here</a>. 
        The top one will be the most recent. You can view the downloads 
        by expanding the <i>Assets</i> tab at the bottom of the release.

            <h1 style="margin-top:50px;">Working Version</h1>
        </center>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The working version should never be used unless 
        you're developing it. It's broken more often than not. That said, 
        you can download it <a href="https://github.com/JakeGuy11/image-sourcerer">here</a>. To download it, click 
        the green <i>Code</i> button, then <i>Download ZIP</i>.
