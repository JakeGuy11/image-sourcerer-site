            </center>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Whenever you see an image on supported sites, 
            a red download icon will appear somewhere near it - it may be 
            on a post the image is from, it may be in a nearby convienient 
            spot, it may even be on the image itself. When you see one of 
            these buttons around an image you would like to download, click 
            it and follow the pop-up's instructions. Sometimes, there is only 
            one download button for multiple images. When this is the case, 
            you will be prompted for which image to download. When prompted 
            for where to save the image, exclude the file extension. Non-latin 
            characters <i>are</i> allowed. Images will be saved in <code>[your 
            downloads folder]/Image-Sourcerer/[path that you enter]</code>. 
            Adding a <code>/</code> to the path will save it into a subfolder.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you have followed these instructions but are 
            still encountering a problem, do the following; Make sure you're 
            on a supported site. The extension will never work if the site is 
            not supported! Then, check the <b>Known Bugs</b> section. Some 
            bugs are known about and are being worked on. If you still haven't 
            found an answer, please navigate to the <b>Report a Bug</b> section 
            below to let us know about it!

            </center>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Image Sourcerer is an extension that allows 
            you to download images from supported sites. If the site is 
            not explicitly supported by the extension, you will not be 
            able to use it. The following is a list of currently supported 
            sites and their statuses:
            <ul>
                <li style="font-size:18px;">Twitter</li>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-size:14px;">Support is complete, no known bugs</li>
                </ul>
                <li style="font-size:18px;">Pixiv</li>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-size:14px;">Support is nearing completion, 3 known bugs</li>
                </ul>
                <li style="font-size:18px;">Danbooru</li>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-size:14px;">Support is complete, no known bugs</li>
                </ul>
                <li style="font-size:18px;">Reddit</li>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-size:14px;">Support is minimal - do not use</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            You can read more about any mentioned bugs in the <b>Known Bugs</b> 
            section below. If you would like to see a site get support, read the 
            <b>Request a Site</b> section below. If you would like an automatic 
            form for site requests, consider donating in order to upgrade the 
            server!

                <h1 style="margin-top:50px;">Transferring Images</h1>
            </center>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Image Sourcerer stores data inside the images you 
            download by appending a base-64 string on the end of the image. This 
            is fairly easy to accomplish, but because it's not nessisary to the 
            actual image data, some tools will remove it when you open the image. 
            In general, any tool or site that can change the image's contents will 
            remove it. Sites like Twitter and imgur also downscale images to save 
            storage, so the data will be lost if you upload it to those. Raw transfers 
            will not loose the data, for example sending it over Discord or SMS. Some 
            email services will remove it, so be cautious.

            Read their description for further information. This list is

                <ul class="bug-list" style="font-size:14px;">
                    <li class="bug-blue">Download times on all Pixiv images 
                    are very long. This is because a proxy server is needed for 
                    downloads. Consider donating to decrease the download times!

            </center>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As mentioned above, only supported sites let you 
            download images from them. Programming support for a site can take 
            anywhere from a week to multiple months depending on how it is 
            designed. Because of this, it may take a while to add support for 
            a site you request, so please be patient.<br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There are a few ways to request support for a 
            site. First, and most effective, is to <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/NQnk3R8u26">join the Discord</a> 
            and send your request to <i>#site-request</i>. Alternatively, 
            you can email us at image.sourcerer.extension@gmail.com.<br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you would like an official form for site 
            requests, please consider donating so we can afford a server 
            that supports it! You can find more details in the
