            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Whenever you see an image on supported sites, 
            a red download icon will appear somewhere near it - it may be 
            on a post the image is from, it may be in a nearby convienient 
            spot, it may even be on the image itself. When you see one of 
            these buttons around an image you would like to download, click 
            it and follow the pop-up's instructions. Sometimes, there is only 
            one download button for multiple images. When this is the case, 
            you will be prompted for which image to download.<br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you have followed these instructions but are 
            still encountering a problem, do the following; Make sure you're 
            on a supported site. The extension will never work if the site is 
            not supported! Then, check the <b>Known Bugs</b> section. Some 
            bugs are known about and are being worked on. If you still haven't 
            found an answer, please navigate to the <b>Report a Bug</b> section 
            below to let us know about it!

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Image Sourcerer is an extension that allows 
            you to download images from supported sites. If the site is 
            not explicitly supported by the extension, you will not be 
            able to use it. The following is a list of currently supported 
            sites and their statuses:
